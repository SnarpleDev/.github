# Welcome to Snarple!

Hello! We are Snarple, a app development organization based in Canada.
We make apps related to Scratch, the programming language.
We don't primarily focus on the Scratch programming language, but on the website and it's features
We currently have a few members, which actively develop our products. Come and explore the world of Snarple!

## Apps

We make a few apps or services related to Scratch, listed below.

### Snazzle

Snazzle is our first product and largest project at Snarple. All of the other services made by us were most likely an offspin technology needed because of Snazzle.
Snazzle is a better and more customizable frontend to Scratch, in which we are constantly adding more and more customizability to it.
We actively develop Snazzle, and are constantly giving updates to it. Stay tuned on our Github for newest versions and features of Snazzle!

### Voyager

Voyager is our second project at Snarple, an offspin service due to Snazzle.
Voyager is a scraper and a database combined into one. Voyager has two major parts: The scraper (Pioneer) and the database (Horizons)
